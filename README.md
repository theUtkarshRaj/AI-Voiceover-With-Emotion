# 🎤 AI Voiceover with Emotion
## Live Demo

You can view the live demo of the app here: [Streamlit App](https://codewrapper.streamlit.app/)

## 🎯 Objective

Our goal is to develop an AI/ML model that enhances AI-generated voiceovers by accurately capturing and conveying emotions in the input sentences. This solution aims to make AI voiceovers more natural, engaging, and effective by integrating appropriate emotional cues.

## 🌟 Overview

The project revolves around creating an intelligent system capable of generating and recognizing emotionally expressive audio based on the sentiment of the input statement. The system will utilize advanced natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) techniques to analyze the text and generate corresponding audio with the intended emotion. We will be integrating the Typecast API to achieve high-quality voiceovers.

## 🛠️ Key Features

- **Emotion-Driven Audio Generation**
  - Generate audio with emotions such as happiness, excitement, anger, sadness, and politeness.
  - Analyze the input statement to determine the suitable emotion to be expressed in the generated audio.
- **Emotion Recognition**
  - Recognize the emotion from user-provided audio or text inputs.
  - Adjust the generated voiceover to match or complement the recognized emotion.
- **Interactive User Interface**
  - Building interactive user interface for inputting statements and receiving emotionally expressive audio outputs.
  - Support for real-time processing to ensure a seamless user experience.
- **Language Support**
  - Both input and output will be in English.
- **Emotion Variety**
  - Accurate generation and recognition of basic emotions with potential for additional emotions for bonus points.

## 🚀 Example Use Cases

- **Expressing Happiness**
  - Input: "I won a gold medal!"
  - Output: Audio conveying a happy and excited tone.
- **Expressing Anger**
  - Input: "This is unacceptable behavior."
  - Output: Audio reflecting anger or frustration.
- **Expressing Sadness**
  - Input: "I can't believe it's over."
  - Output: Audio sounding sad or distressed.
- **Expressing Politeness**
  - Input: "Could you please pass the salt?"
  - Output: Audio with a polite and courteous tone.

 ## 📂 Implementation Steps

### Data Collection and Preprocessing

1. **Data Collection:**
   - Collect audio datasets with labeled emotions from reliable sources.
   - Ensure datasets cover a wide range of emotional expressions.

2. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Preprocess audio data to extract relevant features like MFCCs (Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients), chroma features, and mel spectrograms.
   - Normalize and standardize features for consistent input to the model.

### Emotion Detection using NLP

1. **Sentiment Analysis:**
   - Utilize NLP techniques (such as Vader sentiment analysis, TextBlob, or custom models) to analyze text input and detect sentiment.
   - Classify sentiments into predefined emotion categories (e.g., happiness, sadness, anger).

### Emotion Mapping to Audio Cues

1. **Emotion Mapping:**
   - Establish a mapping between detected emotions (from sentiment analysis) and corresponding audio cues.
   - Define parameters for adjusting pitch, tone, and speed based on the detected emotion.

### Real-time Audio Generation

1. **Model Development:**
   - Develop a machine learning model (using TensorFlow/Keras) for generating emotionally expressive audio.
   - Train the model using preprocessed audio data and mapped emotional cues.

2. **Real-time Processing:**
   - Implement real-time processing capabilities to convert text input or uploaded audio files into emotionally expressive audio output.
   - Ensure low latency and high fidelity in audio generation.

### User Interface Integration

1. **Interactive Interface:**
   - Design and implement a user-friendly interface (using Flask or alternative technologies) for users to input text statements or upload audio files.
   - Enable real-time interaction with the AI-generated emotional voiceovers.

## 🏁 Conclusion

This project aims to revolutionize AI voiceovers by integrating emotional expressions, making them more natural, engaging, and effective. By leveraging advanced AI/ML techniques and the Typecast API, we can significantly enhance the quality of AI-generated audio, providing a more authentic and engaging user experience.

The implementation steps outlined above—from data collection and preprocessing to real-time audio generation and user interface integration—are crucial in achieving our objective. Through continuous refinement and integration of state-of-the-art technologies, we aim to set a new standard in emotional AI voiceover capabilities.
